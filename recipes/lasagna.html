        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Cheese</li>
          <li>Pasta</li>
          <li>Tomato</li>
          <li>Herbs</li>
          <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Boil a large pot of water, cook
            the pasta sheets until al dente, then drain and set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a pan, cook ground beef or sausage (if using) until browned. Add
            tomatoes, herbs, and simmer for 10-15 minutes to make the sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a bowl, mix ricotta cheese, an egg, and a pinch of salt together.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread a layer of sauce in a baking dish, followed by a layer of
            pasta sheets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture, then add mozzarella and
            Parmesan cheese.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat layers (sauce, pasta, ricotta, cheese) until all ingredients
            are used, finishing with cheese on top.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover with foil and bake for 25-30 minutes. Remove foil and bake for
            another 10-15 minutes until cheese is golden. Let it cool for 10
            minutes before serving.
