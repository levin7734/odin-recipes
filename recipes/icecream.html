          Making vanilla ice cream can be time-consuming, but the results are
          well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and
          step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the
          basics:
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Milk</li>
          <li>Vanilla</li>
          <li>Sugar</li>
          <li>Salt</li>
          <li>Ice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a medium saucepan, combine the milk, sugar, and a pinch of salt.
            Heat the mixture over medium heat until the sugar is fully
            dissolved.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the vanilla extract. Stir
            until well mixed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow the mixture to cool down completely by placing it in the
            fridge for about an hour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the mixture is cold, pour it into an ice cream maker and churn
            according to the manufacturer's instructions.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you don't have an ice cream maker, pour the mixture into a
            shallow dish and place it in the freezer. Stir it every 30 minutes
            until it reaches a creamy consistency (usually about 4 hours).
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the ice cream is thickened, you can enjoy it immediately as
            soft-serve or freeze it for a firmer texture.
          </li>
        </ol>
